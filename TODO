flickr userid / username disambiguation, somehow? Do they result in the same feed url?

Sort out licenses!

display online/offline status if possible.

use gravatar to fetch picture if there's nothing in addressbook

consider: maybe it's not worth displaying the window if we have nothing useful to say?

rename 'atom' to 'block' everywhere

blocks maybe want a little 'refresh' icon on them?

Guessed blocks have the 'G' symbol. clicking this symbol should offer to add
it to the address book card.

Expanding links using the google social graph should be turnoffable. And add
a button to do it on demand.

Display AIM and facebook statues somehow.

Normalize urls before testing them against the addressbook to catch, eg, deli.cio.us -> delicious.com change

Follow redirects on urls where possible so we don't repeat sources (eg jerakeen.org/photos appears as a new source,
though it's just a redirect to my flickr page now)

Google Chrome support is very rough, though this is mostly a limitation of the lousy AppleScript it offers. Keep an
eye on it.

First display of shelf for a person seems sluggish - is it fetching things from the network before deciding if it needs
to display the card? I'd rather open the window (in the background) as soon as possible to provide feedback that we
might know something.

If the clue doesn't change, try not to do rediscovery of it. Or at least profile it and verify to myself that it's
cheap. But I'd rather just not do re-discovery. The point is to get active app pings cheap enough that I can drop the
hearbeat to one second.
