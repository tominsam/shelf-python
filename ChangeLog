### 0.0.15 (2011-02-28)

Made work under Snow Leopard, Python 2.6, etc (Anil Madhavapeddy)

Crazy experimental Google Reader support (Safari only)

Support more versions of Chrome, hopefully. They keep changing the AS support.

Added a Spotlight provider that attempts to grab e-mail messages and 
attachments exchanged with a particular contact (Rui Carmo)

Tightened up indents and removed blank lines in some files to make it 
easier to work on a somewhat cramped screen.

### 0.0.14

last.fm changed their XML order? Anyway, I now explicitly order the tracks
in the client.

Replaces simlpejson with json - requires Python 2.6, but Snow Leopard has that
and I'm not really interested in supporting anything else.

### 0.0.13 (released 2008-03-28)

All blocks are now sorted by date, rather than just Feed blocks. This means
that if a contact has blogged something more recently than they've twittered
something, the blog block will be above the twitter block.

The Dopplr provider is back and working again. It now properly uses the
Dopplr auth-bounce code to get itself a token from Dopplr, so should actually
be usable by people other than me.

Lots of trivial little encoding fixes and catches for annoying 'other apps
suck' failure cases.

RSS feed items without titles no longer break the Feed provider.

If you live in a non-GMT timezone, dates now work. Hurrah for going to
conferences and having to suffer under my own bugs.

### 0.0.12 (released 2008-02-14)

Shelf now has a preference to only poll for context and display the window if
a global shortcut key is pressed (currently, this is hard-coded to
Command-Ctrl-J). Turning this on will stop Shelf from polling, it'll manually
display the window when you press the hotkey. BUG - turning this preference
off will require a restart of Shelf before the polling starts again. And yes,
I'll make the key configurable soon.

Feed entries now display about how long ago they were, rather than absolute
times. Do we like this? Maybe this should be a preference.

Messed with the flickr photo display style to include titles, and have smaller
thumbnails. I think I prefer this way.

Special casing for last.fm urls is now in, so you'll see your contact's
recently-played tracks and coverart, if available.

Special-casing for the few pages I know of that have
[totally broken RSS feeds](http://jerakeen.org/blog/2008/02/irritating-rss-feed-links/)
to supress them from the feedlists.

Feeds in the display are now ordered with the most recently updated feed at
the top of the list. 'Special' feeds (twitter, flickr, lastfm) are still
ordered above all others. I'll change this soon.

We now correctly strip CSS styling from feed contents.

The file cache now cleans itself up. The first run of the app may take a
while... Sorry.

The feedprovider de-dupes its blocks based on the feed url, rather than
the page url. No more repeated flickr photos blocks because they have more than
one different url to their photos.

If there are rel="me" links in the current page, and you're using Safari,
I can use them directly to resolve context rather than relying on google
to have spidered the page.

Blocks that have come from the Google Social Graph or have otherwise been
guessed now have a little 'G' in their title bar. Ugly, but I want a way of
distinguishing them a little.

Shelf now sends a proper User-Agent to remote servers when fetching feeds.

Documented large chunks of the source much better.

Removed the xmltramp library, using simplejson to parse the Dopplr API files
instead. Not that the Dopplr module works. But if it did, I would.



### 0.0.11 (released 2008-02-06)

Feed provider now displays the first 10 words of the blog entry under the
heading, and the entry date.

Add 'birthday' to the list of simple information displayed about a user.

I now use the Google Social Graph to try to derive a person from a page you're
looking at, if that page isn't already in your address book. Likewise, I use
the Google Social Graph to find out more urls from someone once I have one URL
for them. So if your homepage links to your flickr page, and only your
homepage is in my address book, I'll still see your flickr photos when I visit
your home page, and I'll see you if I visit your flickr page. Magic.

The Google Social stuff is off by default - there are two preferences for
turning it on. This is because it's a privacy _nightmare_ - it sends every URL
you visit, and every URL belonging to anyone you IM with, to Google.

There are now some trivial preferences for how you want Shelf to display - the
old default behaviours of 'always come to the foreground when I have something
to tell you' and 'window is always on top if there is context' are now
options.

#### Known bugs

The Dopplr module is currently broken, due to the odd SSL certificate Dopplr
use. Sorry. Working on it.

The RSS feed fetcher shares a cookie store with Safari. This may or may not
be a bug or a feature, depending on your point of view. Anyone care?

#### Technical changes:

Converted build process to use py2app rather than xcode, because I know how to
make py2app dance to my tunes. Specifically, I know how to make it pull in
external libraries and bundle them properly. Reorganised source files into
folders so I can keep track of where things are.

_Huge_ great internal re-write. Many more code-paths are now much more
message-passing based, and can do things in the background. The Google Social
stuff uses this, so no longer blocks the foreground thread.



### 0.0.10 (released 2008-01-11)

I've taken a random stab at CSS styling - the thing is a lot prettier now,
though that's not really saying much. Input welcome. 'themes' (spit) are
planned, of course. But till then, at least it isn't just a default webkit
display now.

The webkit view now has crude click-through, which is useful as the window
is always on top, so of course you want to follow that link. But it _doesn't_
have hover-through, so you won't see link mouseover effects just yet.
Annoying.

Companies in the address book are recognised as such, and display the company
name first. They have a different default icon.

The NetNewsWire clue provider now tries to find a person based on the target of
the currently viewed headline first, then falls back to the feed URL, rather
than just using the feed URL. It also looks for Microformats in the body of
the feed item before considering URLs. I may reconsider the ordering here,
though.

Hopefully better URL disambiguation now - www. on the beginning of addresses
can be considered optional.

The display will hang around a little longer if it thinks you're no longer
looking at someone interesting, to try to bridge the gap if you're navigating
to a resource about the same person.

Mattb had an odd crashing bug that I don't understand, where there seemed to be
no 'active application'. I'm now guarding against this case.

Shelf now stops correctly when quit. oops.



### 0.0.8 (released 2008-01-10)

New icon, thanks Rui.

I'm sure there was something else. I decide I should start keeping a ChangeLog.
